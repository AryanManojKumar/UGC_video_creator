Brand context (LOCKED):
Industry: {industry}
Audience: {audience}
Vibe: {vibe}

This context must subtly influence the dialogue through:
- Word choice and phrasing that resonates with the audience
- Energy level and pacing that matches the vibe
- Relatability to the industry space

Do NOT:
- Repeat the brand context verbatim
- Use marketing slogans or ad language
- Add calls-to-action

Dialogue requirements:
- Target 18–26 words (slightly longer than typical ads)
- The dialogue should be around the image and the product 
- Use natural spoken pacing with short pauses implied by commas or em dashes
- Dialogue should feel like one continuous thought, not punchy slogans
- Allow reflective, moment-to-moment narration (e.g., effort, progress, mindset)
- First-person only ("I", "my")
- Calm, grounded delivery — not rushed
- No call-to-action
- No exaggerated excitement
- Must be safe for continuous lip motion (no abrupt stops)

Style guidance:
- Think "talking while doing something" rather than "selling"
- Avoid sharp sentence breaks; prefer flowing phrases
- One idea evolving into the next
- Let the brand context influence the creator's voice naturally

Output ONLY the dialogue text.
No quotes. No labels.

BRAND CONTEXT (LOCKED):
Industry: {industry}
Audience: {audience}
Vibe: {vibe}

This context must subtly influence the video script through:
- Visual energy and body language that matches the vibe
- Framing and environment that feels authentic to the industry
- Overall creator presence that resonates with the audience

Do NOT:
- Repeat the brand context verbatim
- Add marketing elements or text overlays
- Force unnatural product placement

DIALOGUE CONTEXT:
The creator will be speaking the provided dialogue using visual-only lip motion (NO AUDIO).

CORE OBJECTIVE:
Generate a SINGLE, continuous-shot, production-ready 8-second UGC video script that is perfectly stable for lip-sync and identity consistency.

ABSOLUTE STRUCTURE CONSTRAINT (MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS):
- The video MUST be ONE continuous shot from start to end
- NO scene changes, NO cuts, NO transitions, NO jump cuts
- Do NOT describe multiple scenes, moments, or locations
- Do NOT use words such as: "Scene 1", "Scene 2", "cut", "montage", "jump", "hero shot", "end card"
- The camera framing MUST remain consistent for the full duration

GLOBAL RULES (CRITICAL):
- Assume the person, face, body, clothing, hair, and environment come directly from the provided UGC image reference
- Do NOT invent new outfits, props, locations, text, graphics, music, or sound effects
- The video is ALWAYS silent (no speech audio, no music, no ambient sound)
- Do NOT include on-screen text, subtitles, captions, or stickers
- Everything described must be physically filmable and realistic

LIP MOTION CONSTRAINT (MANDATORY):
- continuous speech-mimicking lip motion MUST persist from 0 seconds through the final frame
- Lip motion must NOT pause, stop, freeze, or reset at any time
- Lip motion continues even if all other motion becomes minimal near the end

PRODUCT HANDLING RULES (MANDATORY):
- The product must NEVER approach the mouth or face
- NO sipping, NO pretending to drink
- Product stays below chin level at all times (chest or torso height only)
- Grip must look relaxed and natural
- Product position remains generally stable throughout the clip

PRODUCT VISIBILITY & BRAND SAFETY:
- The product must NEVER be fully visible
- Only a partial section of the product may appear in frame
- Fingers, framing, or crop must naturally obscure fine printed text, nutrition labels, and barcodes
- Logo may be partially visible but not fully readable

CAMERA & MOTION STYLE:
- Medium close-up framing (chest to face)
- Subtle handheld realism only
- NO zooms, NO punch-ins, NO pans, NO fast movement
- Allowed motion is limited to:
  • natural head micro-movement
  • subtle hand micro-adjustments
  • minor posture shifts

EXPRESSION & PERFORMANCE:
- Natural, confident creator demeanor
- Calm, conversational facial expression
- NO exaggerated acting, laughter, or dramatic reactions
- Eye contact with the camera should feel intentional and steady

ENDING FRAME (IMPORTANT):
- The final frame must visually match the previous frames
- Motion may gently settle, but lip motion MUST continue
- The ending frame should be stable enough to chain into the next clip seamlessly

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT — FOLLOW EXACTLY):

If the script would require more than one scene, camera change, cut, subtitle, or sip — DO NOT GENERATE IT.
